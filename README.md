
## Overview
This project aims to develop a Human Pose Detection and Recommendation System that analyzes human body posture using computer vision techniques, specifically MediaPipe Pose for pose estimation and OpenCV for video processing. The system provides real-time feedback on joint angles to improve posture. This project has potential applications in fields such as sports, exercise coaching, rehabilitation, and ergonomics.
## Title and Description
Title: Human Pose Detection and Recommendation System
Description: The code utilizes MediaPipe Pose and OpenCV to identify human joint angles in a video and compare them with predefined reference angles. If the detected angle deviates from the optimal reference by a specified threshold, the system provides real-time feedback on how to adjust the posture.

## Research Findings
This system is based on research into human pose estimation and posture analysis. Research shows that maintaining certain joint angles (like elbows at 160° and knees at 170°) can be indicative of good posture, especially in various physical activities. The following key areas informed this project’s design:

Human Pose Estimation: Studies show that using joint landmarks for calculating angles is a reliable approach for assessing posture. MediaPipe’s pose landmarks make it possible to measure these angles with high accuracy.

Posture Correction: Deviations from optimal joint angles can indicate poor form, which is crucial to detect in activities like exercise to avoid injuries. Research suggests that providing feedback on joint positions can significantly enhance user posture.

These findings guided the choice of joint angles, landmarks, and feedback criteria in the current project.


## Data Preparation

The data preparation process involved the following steps:

Video Collection: A sample video (/content/sample.avi) was used as the input, representing scenarios with varied postures.
Frame-by-Frame Processing: The video was processed frame-by-frame using OpenCV. Each frame was analyzed for joint angles and overlaying posture recommendations if needed.
Landmark Detection and Angle Calculation: MediaPipe Pose was used to detect body landmarks, particularly focusing on elbows and knees to calculate angles.
Preprocessing:
Frame Resizing: Frames were resized to a consistent resolution.
Angle Calculation: The angles were calculated using the shoulder-elbow-wrist for elbows and hip-knee-ankle for knees.
Annotation: For each frame where deviation was detected, recommendations like "Adjust left elbow position" were overlaid on the video.
The data preparation steps allowed for a smooth and consistent video processing workflow, enabling accurate posture feedback.

Model and Training Parameters
MediaPipe Pose (Pose Estimation):

Model Choice: MediaPipe Pose was chosen for its high accuracy in human pose estimation and its ability to work in real-time.
Pre-trained Model: The code uses MediaPipe’s pre-trained pose model, which does not require additional training or fine-tuning.
Pose Detection Parameters:
static_image_mode=False: Optimized for real-time video.
min_detection_confidence=0.5: Minimum confidence threshold for pose detection.
min_tracking_confidence=0.5: Minimum confidence threshold for landmark tracking.
Angle Threshold and Reference Angles:

Reference Angles:
Left and Right Elbows: 160°
Left and Right Knees: 170°
Angle Threshold: A 15° deviation threshold was chosen, meaning if the detected angle is off by more than 15°, a recommendation is triggered.
The pre-trained MediaPipe Pose model and threshold values were selected based on research findings to ensure reliable and accurate posture feedback without the need for custom training.
